# Claude Code Action

A general-purpose [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. This action intelligently detects when to activate based on your workflow context—whether responding to @claude mentions, issue assignments, or executing automation tasks with explicit prompts. It supports multiple authentication methods including Anthropic direct API, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex AI.

## Features

- 🎯 **Intelligent Mode Detection**: Automatically selects the appropriate execution mode based on your workflow context—no configuration needed
- 🤖 **Interactive Code Assistant**: Claude can answer questions about code, architecture, and programming
- 🔍 **Code Review**: Analyzes PR changes and suggests improvements
- ✨ **Code Implementation**: Can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features
- 💬 **PR/Issue Integration**: Works seamlessly with GitHub comments and PR reviews
- 🛠️ **Flexible Tool Access**: Access to GitHub APIs and file operations (additional tools can be enabled via configuration)
- 📋 **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators with checkboxes that dynamically update as Claude completes tasks
- 🏃 **Runs on Your Infrastructure**: The action executes entirely on your own GitHub runner (Anthropic API calls go to your chosen provider)
- ⚙️ **Simplified Configuration**: Unified `prompt` and `claude_args` inputs provide clean, powerful configuration aligned with Claude Code SDK

## 📦 Upgrading from v0.x?

**See our [Migration Guide](./docs/migration-guide.md)** for step-by-step instructions on updating your workflows to v1.0. The new version simplifies configuration while maintaining compatibility with most existing setups.

## Quickstart

The easiest way to set up this action is through [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) in the terminal. Just open `claude` and run `/install-github-app`.

This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.

**Note**:

- You must be a repository admin to install the GitHub app and add secrets
- This quickstart method is only available for direct Anthropic API users. For AWS Bedrock or Google Vertex AI setup, see [docs/cloud-providers.md](./docs/cloud-providers.md).

## Example Usage

Add a workflow file (e.g. `.github/workflows/claude.yml`) that runs the action when `@claude` is mentioned in an issue or PR comment:

```yaml
name: Claude Code

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  pull_request_review_comment:
    types: [created]
  issues:
    types: [opened, assigned]

jobs:
  claude:
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, '@claude') || contains(github.event.issue.body, '@claude')
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      pull-requests: write
      issues: write
      id-token: write
      actions: read # Allows Claude to read CI results on PRs
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1
        with:
          anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}
          # Optional: pass CLI arguments to Claude Code
          # claude_args: |
          #   --model claude-opus-4-1-20250805
          #   --max-turns 10
```

More ready-to-use workflows — automated PR review, CI auto-fix, issue deduplication, and provider-specific setups — are in the [`examples/`](./examples) directory.
